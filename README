Scripts resolves hostname / ip under cursor, using `host` command. It can either echo the result (<Leader>re / <Leader>rs), or substitute relevant part of the buffer (<Leader>rE / <Leader>rS). Currently resolving A / SRV / PTR is supported, but adding other types should be trivial if anyone needs them.
